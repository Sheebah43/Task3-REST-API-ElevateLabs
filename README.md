# Task3-REST-API-ElevateLabs
I am starting the "TaskX-ABC-@ElevateLabs" repository as an initial step towards working with Elevate Labs for my internship. Every assigned task will be uploaded to separate repositories named "TaskX@-ABC-ElevateLabs", where X will be the count of tasks attempted and "ABC" will be replaced by a task title string. This will help me and the hiring team keep track of my performance.
17-11-2025: Task 3: This time the task was to create a REST API for the management of a list of books. In order to achieve the said task, we had to use Node.js and express. I had never built anything like this. For me, this was probably more alien than the previous two tasks combined. I ran into a lot of errors while trying to test it. I took the help of Microsoft Copilot, asked it a lot of questions and bothered it a lot. It eventually worked, but I can't say that I am satisfied with how I did this task. I heavily relied on Copilot for this one, which beats the purpose of calling it "Copilot". I can't say that I have a complete hold on this type of task now, but I definitely learned a thing or two.
Not to mention how I almost tried committing the node_module as well. T_T
